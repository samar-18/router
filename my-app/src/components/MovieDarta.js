Title:'SOUL',
description:'Soul" is about a musician who is transported out of his body and he must find his way back into actually living. This film is transcending the depths of Pixars most introspective animations. Every facet comes together beautifully to create an emotional symphony, resulting in a heartbreakingly optimistic narrative. It feels like too much for kids, but the script allows it all to come together beautifully with the emotionally powerful third act, including a heartwarming tear-inducing score and a relatable, well-explored story about the meaning of life. Soul may not have the laugh-out-loud sense of humor as other Pixar greats do, but it will touch hearts nonetheless.',
